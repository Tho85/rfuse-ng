INTRO
=====

This project was forked from rfuse, a great FUSE language
binding for Ruby.

There is an other such binding called FuseFS but it does
not implement all the necessary callbacks to do certain
important operations.

The rfuse project was probably abandoned in 2005, this is
why I have started this project.

DEPENDENCIES
============

ruby 1.8
fuse 2.8
